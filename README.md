## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM


### What I learned

In this challenge, I chose to start using SASS and BEM methodology, it was hard to adapt but I will continually improve it.

I also cut some background images to avoid horizontal scrolling.


### Continued development

- SASS
- BEM

### Useful resources

- [isotropic.co](https://isotropic.co/tool/hex-color-to-css-filter) - This helped me to convert an HEX color to Filter value in css.
